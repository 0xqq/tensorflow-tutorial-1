# TensorFlowTutorial
Learn TensorFlow from scratch with examples and visualizations. Compete in `kaggle.com` challenge: Leaf Detection.

All exercises are designed to be runned from a CPU on a laptio

## Setup and Installation

Guides for downloading and installing TensorFlow on Linux, OSX and Windows using Docker.

## Material

The material consists of 4 labs.

### Lab1

Logistic regression, feed forward neural network (FFN) on the (in)famous MNIST!

### Lab2

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Spatial Transformer on images.

### Lab3

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on Translation using Encoder-Decoder model and Encoder-Decoder with attention.

### Lab4
