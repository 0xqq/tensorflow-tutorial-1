# TensorFlow Tutorial
Learn TensorFlow from scratch with examples and visualizations with interactive jupyer notebooks. Learn to compete in the [Kaggle leaf detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification)!

All exercises are designed to be runned from a CPU on a laptio

## Setup and Installation

Guides for downloading and installing TensorFlow on Linux, OSX and Windows using Docker.

## Material

The material consists of 4 labs.

### Lab1

Logistic regression, feed forward neural network (FFN) on the (in)famous MNIST!

Optional reading material from [Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/):Chapters 1-4 (Do 3-5 of the optional exercises).

### Lab2

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Spatial Transformer on images.

Optional reading material from [Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) Chapter 6 (stop when reaching section called Other approaches to deep neural nets).

### Lab3

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on Translation using Encoder-Decoder model and Encoder-Decoder with attention.

Optional reading material from [Alex Graves](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf) Chapters 3.1, 3.2 and 4,

### Lab4

Compete in the kaggle competition [Leaf Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification) using FFN, CNN and RNN.
